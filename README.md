Developed a Quiz Application using Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, and MySQL, allowing users to take quizzes and view
results. The application supports quiz creation, fetching questions by category, and calculating scores based on user
responses. RESTful APIs were implemented for managing quizzes and questions, including retrieving random
questions and submitting answers for scoring. The project improved my skills in backend development, API design,
and database management.

✅ Spring Boot Backend – Uses Spring Boot for rapid development and efficiency.
✅ MySQL Database Integration – Stores questions, quizzes, and results securely.
✅ RESTful APIs – Supports CRUD operations for quizzes and questions.
✅ Dynamic Question Fetching – Retrieves random questions based on categories.
✅ Score Calculation – Evaluates answers and returns scores instantly.
